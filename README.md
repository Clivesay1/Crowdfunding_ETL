CONTENTS:
    -In the following Repo, You will find: 
        ~An Outputs Folder: Consists of 4 (four) CSV files created: campaign_csv, category_csv, contacts_csv, and subcategory_csv.
        ~Resources Folder: Consists of the original starter code, the contacts excel file, and crowdfunding excel file
        ~Crowdfunding_db_schema.sql: Created via the project
        ~Crowdfunding_db_ERD.png: Created via the project

Chris and Denise work together to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, adn either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. The following methods will be complete the process: create four CSV files and use the files to create and ERD and a table schema. The data is then uploaded into a Postgres database followed by GitLab. 

Instructions:
    Downloaded the starter code and files supplied by the project.
    Software:
        Panda
        Jupyter
        GitHub: In order to collab with a partner seamlessly
        SQL PGADMIN
        Python
        numpy

DATA SOURCES: Can be found in the Resources Folder.
   
First Half of Project:
    Extract the Crowdfunding Data:  
    Firstly the data needs to be turned into a Pandas DataFrame
    Get a brief summary of the crowding_info DataFrame
Create Category dataframe with the following columns:
    subcategory_id
    subcategory
Then, export as a CSV file. 

Create numpy arrays for the categories and subcategories

Create Campaign DataFrame
Convert and verify the data types of the columns

REQUIREMENTS:
A Category DataFrame 
A Subcategory DataFrame
A Campaign DataFrame
A Contacts DataFrame
A Crowdfunding Database
